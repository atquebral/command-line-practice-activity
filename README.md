## Commands

- `pwd` Print working directory
- `cd`: Change Directory
- `ls`: List directory contents
- `mv`: Move or rename
- `cp`: Copy
- `rm`: Remove
- `touch`: Create a file
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory

### Patterns to know

- `cd ../` change directory to parent directory
  - ie: if `/home/documents/project/`, then `cd ../` takes you to `/home/documents/
- `pwd` prints where you are right now
- `ls -la` shows hidden directories and files
- `mv oldfilename newfilename` rename a file
- `cp filename ../otherproject/filename`
  - copies a file back a level and then into a directory called "otherproject"
- `rm -r ./directoryname`
  - removes the specified directory (providing your in the same parent directory)
  - **never ever ever write `rm -rf /`** this will delete literally everything
  - always be certain of where you are when executing `rm` commands
- `touch README.md` creates a markdown file called README
- `mkdir project-name`: Creates a directory called project-name

## Naming Convention Notes

- name multi word files and folders with kebab-case
  - example: `mkdir assignment-1`
  - as a developer, spaces in filenames are not your friend
- name javascript files with camelCase or PascalCase (default to camelCase)
  - example: `touch errorLogger.js` for a utility function that formats error logging
  - example: `touch CardButton.js` for a react component that is a Button specifically formatted for a Card component
